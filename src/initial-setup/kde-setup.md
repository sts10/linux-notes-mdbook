# KDE Setup and Troubleshooting

Basically, if you go with the Kubuntu "Minimal Install", configure KDE with your heart.

## KDE Troubleshooting

### Everything looks big!

If, after installing the proper NVIDIA drivers and restarting the machine, everything looks big, go to Fonts settings menu and "Force" the DPI to 96.

### If external monitors aren't being recognized by your laptop

If external monitors aren't being recognized by your laptop, try opening "NVIDIA X Server Settings", then select "X Server Display Configuration" from the menu you on the left. Try clicking "Detect Displays". 

If the external monitor appears in the layout, it may just be "disabled". If that's the case, go to the drop-down menu on the right side of the window labeled "Configuration" and try choosing "X screen 0".
