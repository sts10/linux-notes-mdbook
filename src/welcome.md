# Linux Notes

Welcome! This is an [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook) full on notes that Sam Schlinkert has written about installing and running a Linux desktop. It's mostly for personal reference, but you may find it useful. It mostly pertains to Ubuntu-based systems. 

## Config Files

Most of my Linux config files (as opposed to guides, which is what this site is mostly made up of) live in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/sts10/linux-config). (Separately, I keep [an Alacritty config file as a Gist](https://gist.github.com/sts10/df620672662fe4c6f03ac296a02b8e72).)
